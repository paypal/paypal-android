# Feature Client Session Stores

**Status: Pending**

## Context

In the past, specifically with the Braintree Android SDK, we made an attempt to improve the developer experience by providing our own solution for process recovery. We later found that our solution for process recovery was too opinonated for a small minority of merchant apps. The fact that many valid Android app architectures exist prevents us from providing a one-size-fits-all solution for process recoveryâ€“we simply cannot support every possible Android app architecture.

Our current solution to allow merchants to recover from an Android process kill requires merchants to keep a reference to an `authState` value during a browser-switched flows. The merchant app is fully responsible for restoring itself after its process has been terminated by the Android OS.

While the current solution does prevent the SDK having an opinion on how the merchant app should be architected, it is somewhat error prone. We not only require merchants to keep a reference to a pending `authState` value, we also require them to discard the same reference when an app switch has completed. This is necessary to prevent the SDK from attempting to handle an app switch that has already completed.
