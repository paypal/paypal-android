# PayPal SDK Migration Guide

This guide highlights how to migrate to the latest version of the PayPal SDK.

> For evolution of this guide, see the MIGRATION_GUIDE for [v2.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/paypal/paypal-android/blob/4afcf913ae8ae91c741faa4a7d49f8ba44765117/v2_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Card Payments

We refactored the `CardClient` API to improve the developer experience. Use this diff to guide your migration from `v1` to `v2`:

```diff
-class SampleActivity: ComponentActivity(), ApproveOrderListener, CardVaultListener {
+class SampleActivity: ComponentActivity() {

  val config = CoreConfig("<CLIENT_ID>", environment = Environment.LIVE)
- val cardClient = CardClient(requireActivity(), config)
+ val cardClient = CardClient(requireContext(), config)
+ var authState: String? = null

- init {
-   cardClient.approveOrderListener = this
-   cardClient.vaultListener = this
- }

+ override fun onResume() {
+   super.onResume()
+   // Manually attempt auth challenge completion (via host activity intent deep link)
+   checkForCardAuthCompletion(intent)
+ }

+ override fun onNewIntent(newIntent: Intent) {
+   super.onNewIntent(newIntent)
+   // Manually attempt auth challenge completion (via new intent deep link)
+   checkForCardAuthCompletion(newIntent)
+ }

  fun approveOrder() {
    val cardRequest: CardRequest = TODO("Create a card request.")
-   cardClient.approveOrder(this, cardRequest)

  }

+       authState = null // Discard auth state when done
+     }
+
+     CardFinishApproveOrderResult.NoResult -> {
+       // there isn't enough information to determine the state of the auth challenge for this payment method
+     }
+   }

<summary><b>Notes on Changes to Card Payments in v2</b></summary>

Here are some detailed notes on the changes made to Card Payments in v2:

### Activity Reference no Longer Required in CardClient Constructor

- In `v1` the activity reference is only truly needed when the call to `CardClient#approveOrder()` or `CardClient#vault()` is made (to open a Chrome Custom Tab in the current Task).
- In `v2` the `CardClient` constructor no longer requires an activity reference.
- The goal of this change is to increase flexibility of `CardClient` instantiation.

### Moving from Implicit (Automatic) to Manual Completion of Auth Challenges

- In `v1` the SDK registers a lifecycle observer to parse incoming deep links when the host application comes into the foreground.
- In `v2` the host application is responsible for calling `CardClient#completeAuthChallenge()` to attempt completion of an auth challenge.
- The goal of this change is to make the SDK less opinionated and give host applications more control over the auth challenge user experience.

### Migration from Listener Patern to Result Types

- In `v1` the SDK would notify the host application of success, failure, etc. events using a registered listener
- In `v2` the host application will receive a sealed class `Result` type in response to each method invocation
- The goal of this change is to prevent having to retain listener references and to make auth challenge presentation more explicit
- Sealed class result types also have the added benefit of explicitly calling out all possible outcomes of a related method inovcation

## PayPal Web Payments

We refactored the `PayPalWebClient` API to improve the developer experience. Use this diff to guide your migration from `v1` to `v2`:

```diff
-class SampleActivity: ComponentActivity(), PayPalWebCheckoutListener, PayPalWebVaultListener {
+class SampleActivity: ComponentActivity() {

  val config = CoreConfig("<CLIENT_ID>", environment = Environment.LIVE)
- val payPalClient = PayPalWebCheckoutClient(requireActivity(), config, "my-deep-link-url-scheme")

## PayPal Native Payments

We have removed `PayPalNativeClient` and all associated classes. The PayPal Native Checkout dependency this module uses has been discontinued.
